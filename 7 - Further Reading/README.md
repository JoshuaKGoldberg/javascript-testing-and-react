# Further Reading

First check out the official documentation for the projects today:
* [Mocha](http://mochajs.org/)
* [Chai](http://chaijs.com/)
* [Sinon](http://sinonjs.org/)
* [Enzyme](http://airbnb.io/enzyme/)

Then read the Wikipedia articles on the ideas to get a more full understanding of the logic and consequences behind them:
* [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)
* [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design))
* [BDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development)

Finally, read the [Art of Unit Testing](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Unit-Testing-examples/dp/1617290890).
It's a great little read that's jam packed with excellent tips for writing good tests.

Finally, feel free to follow up with me at **jogol@microsoft.com** with any questions or comments you have.
I'm always available.

Thanks for listening!
